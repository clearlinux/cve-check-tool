cve-check-tool
---------------

cve-check-tool, as its name suggests, is a tool for checking known
(public) CVEs. The tool will identify potentially vunlnerable software
packages within Linux distributions through version matching. Where
possible it will also seek to determine (through a distribution
implemention) if a vulnerability has been addressed by way of a patch.

For a further discussion on the base concepts of `cve-check-tool`, see
this [talk I gave](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/The%20Devil%20Wears%20RPM.pdf) at LinuxCon EU '15


`TODO` (Phase 1)
================

 - [x] Dump replicant code and rebase onto libnica, purging GLib too
 - [x] Create abstract data source provider type
 - [x] Convert NVD into a single data source, reduced priority
 - [x] Ensure code-coverage and valgrind check integration
 - [x] Completely rework the NVD SQLite database for safety checks and seek speed
 - [ ] Redo the old Template handler for correct subcontext handling. This enables
       output reports in mutliple formats (HTML, CSV, etc.)
 - [ ] Introduce abstract package scanners. For now these will be source-only.
       In future we shall support binary scans too, so keep it abstract..
 - [ ] Re-introduce compatibility with old CLI options or a migration plan.
 - [ ] Work with `cve-check-tool` users to ensure correct deployment of new release.
 - [ ] Send out the new cve-check-tool 6.x
 - [ ] Phase 2.

`Branch 2`
============

`master` has tons of useful code. There are library functions here that
will be reused in this cleanroom reimplementation, to allow a simpler and
more efficient, highly parallel, version of cve-check-tool.

This branch is to be used to reimplement the tool in a more modular and
extendible fashion. It does not necessarily mean we need to sport dynamic
loading of modules like before, however we should factor for multiple
data sources, introspection methods, etc.

Essentially, the core will be split out from the main binaries, allowing
various forms of interaction between various sources, outputs and matchers.

Previously re-implemented portions of code can now be sought from ``libnica``
to provide utilities and data types, as it is well tested and modular of it's
own accord. As a result, it is expected that ``libnica`` will develop new
features in tandem with this branch.

Datasource Management
=====================

The tool makes use of `data sources` to understand vulnerability information,
and how it pertains to product configurations. Currently a single data source
is provided, the `NvdDataSource`. This uses data from the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)

This is implemented internally by consuming the XML feeds provided by the NVD,
and converting them into an instantly usable form, by way of an SQLite3 database.

As these data sources are somewhat large, special care is taken when processing
the database, such as integrity checks, as well as validity checks on the XML
itself. In the instance of any issues, the database is rolled back to the last
good transaction, to prevent any corruption.

Note that new CVE data may only overwrite previously stored data if the modification
data is newer than the last data imported. Doing so ensures consistency even in the
event of non-sequential data imports and subsequent database updates, allowing the
database to remain persistent.
